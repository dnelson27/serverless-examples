# Below are some practice examples of a few serverless deployment techniques.
## I am currently working on:
- Deploying container images with Lambda, integrating with CodePipeline.

## I plan to work on:
- Netlify functions for authentication to Cognito (need to research if its a safe and effective way to authenticate users)
- Serverless low-cost automated attack surface mapping (probably with lambda, probably in Go for speed's sake).
